# British Swimming Officials

England, Scotland and Wales are in alignment over the training of swimming officials. This means training is standardised across the UK. Read on for details of the demands of each level of training, and the forms to apply.

England, Scotland and Wales have been working towards common standards in the education and training of all swimming officials.

All three Home Countries now use FINA Technical Rules. As such, trained officials are listed as British Swimming Officials. Below is a description of the various training available.

ASA Criteria for the Training of Officials at Licensed Meets

### The Importance of Insurance

All clubs, promoters and competition organisers are reminded that, for insurance purposes, all those officiating on poolside at any competition must be registered members of a British Swimming affiliated club or a member of the Institute of Swimming.

### Officiating
Officials may officiate at County, Regional and National Championships. All applicants must however be qualified to at least Judge Level 1 and must possess a valid official's license.

Equipment: Bring your own stop watches, clipboards and pens.

Apparel: A county shirt is given to each official when licensed to J1 status when they officiate for the County for the first time.  Shirts can be purchased if a further one is required.

All licensed meets are subject to Swim England laws and regulations and the Swim England Technical Rules of Racing. They are graded into four levels. For a detailed description of each level download our Open Meet Licensing Criteria PDF.

* Level 1 Meets are long course (50m) only and cover National, Regional and County Championships. Their purpose is to enable athletes to achieve qualifying times for entry into National, Regional and County Championships.

* Level 2 Meets are short course (25m) only and cover National, Regional and County Championships. Their purpose is to enable athletes to achieve qualifying times for entry into National, Regional and County Championships in short course.

* Level 3 Meets are long and short course events. Their purpose is to enable athletes to achieve times for entry into Regional and County Championships and other Meets at Level 1 or Level 2.
